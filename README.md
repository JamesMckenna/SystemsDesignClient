## Project Notes:

This project is a prototype client application and will go through radical changes before it is considered ready for a production deployment. Currently it is a straight up VueJs / VueX / Vue-Router application, but will eventually be rebuilt to take advantage of both server-side rendering, and client-side rendering, with the intent of harding the app's security. Backend For Frontend Architecture would allow for a more secure user session, allow tokens to be cached on the server as opposed to in client-side JavaScript code. More research is needed.

More research needed before any decision is made. 
Trade-offs to take into consideration:
* SEO
* Time to first paint / render
* Time to first interaction
* Security
